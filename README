Commands:     

- u, d, l, r, f, b to turn up, down, left, right, front and back faces clockwise (whatever cube orientation) 
- c, m, v to turn the three belts clockwise
- shift + letter for turning counterclockwise - ctrl + letter for half turn 
- the whole cube can turn with the four arrows and Pgup/Pgdown keys
- sramble cube with s key, reset it with S

TODO:
- more configurable display
- add some edit technique with a solver algorithm - in order to solve a real cube :-) 
- chrono + high score stuff 
- support for 4x4 and 5x5 cubes 
- write moves in letters when done
- some optimization (seems to be slow on old or "slow networked display" machines) 
- etc.
